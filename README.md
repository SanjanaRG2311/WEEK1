# WEEK1
This project focuses on visualizing the distribution of plastic waste categories using a dataset of images classified as "Organic" or "Recyclable." The code reads images and their labels from a specified dataset directory, processes the data, and stores it in a pandas DataFrame for easy analysis. 
**Features**
Loads and processes image data from a structured dataset.
Uses pandas to organize data and matplotlib for creating visualizations.
Generates:
Pie Chart: Displays the percentage of each waste category with customized colors and styles.
Bar Chart: Visualizes the count of items in each category for comparison.
